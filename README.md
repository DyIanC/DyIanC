### Hi there 👋

I'm Dylan CARON, young developper and student at the University of Paul Sabatier, in Toulouse, in France.
I really like coffee, programming, web technologies, IA, coffee and many more things about IT.
(Did I just said coffee twice ? 😌☕)

I mainly work on somes university projects and some usefull tools or fun things, alone or with my roommate Cyril.

Thanks for stopping by and stay curious. 🐵
